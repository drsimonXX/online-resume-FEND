#Online Resume

Online Resume is a resume project built in conjunction with Udacity staff and [Udacity.com's](http://www.udacity.com "Udacity") [Front-end nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001 "Udacity Front-End Nanodegree"). The Udacity project files can be found [here](https://github.com/drsimonXX/frontend-nanodegree-resume). The online resume displays Danielle R. Simon's resume using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. View the resume [here](https://drsimonxx.github.io/online-resume-FEND/frontend-nanodegree-resume/).

##Contributions

Udacity provided all of the files with some of the code pre-completed. Danielle R. Simon provided all of the JavaScript in the resumeBuilder.js file while Udacity provided all of the code in the index.html and jQuery.js files. The CSS and helper.js files were largely written by Udacity with some tweaks and additions provided by Danielle R. Simon.

##Sections

The online resume is to be used and viewed similarly to traditional resumes. The sections on the resume consist of the following:

1. Contact information (including a fake phone number and fake email address, for privacy purposes)
2. Message, which includes the resume's summary statement
3. Skills, which includes various programming languages, frameworks, libraries
4. Work experience
5. Projects completed to date, including pics
6. Education, including online courses
7. A map using the Google Maps API to iterate through education and work locations and display them
8. Contact information (again)
